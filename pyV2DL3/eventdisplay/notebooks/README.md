## Notebooks

This folder is just for sharing example notebooks within the developers. All the content is in a terrible preliminary state, so if something does not work as expected, don't be impressed.

For now I just uploaded the notebooks I have been playing around with for creating a DL3 file with eventDisplay (everything that works was slowly ported to the V2DL3 scripts already) and interpolating the IRFs.

The only notebook is close to being "clean" is the 'Testing_IRF_interpolation.ipynb'. Please play around with that one if you want to see how the IRF interpolation currently works in the package.
